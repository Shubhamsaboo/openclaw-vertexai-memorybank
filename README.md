# Agent Platform Memory Bank for OpenClaw and Hermes

Managed long-term memory for OpenClaw and [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent), powered by [Agent Platform Memory Bank on Google Cloud](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/memory-bank).

> **Compatibility identifier:** The repository, npm package, and OpenClaw plugin retain `openclaw-vertexai-memorybank` for compatibility. It is not the visible project name.

### Why memory beyond an agent runtime's core memory

Runtime-local memory is commonly limited to an agent or session. This integration adds **user-scoped memory that can work across agents**, so preferences, decisions, and context can persist across sessions. Scope by user, project, or another deliberate isolation boundary.

### Why Agent Platform Memory Bank

Agent Platform Memory Bank is managed on Google Cloud: no vector database to run and no embeddings infrastructure to maintain. It generates and retrieves long-term memories within your Google Cloud project. Generated memories can be consolidated against existing memories in their exact scope.

### Token-efficient and effective

Memories are extracted facts, not raw conversation logs. OpenClaw recalls only relevant memories with similarity search before a turn, while Hermes agents explicitly invoke MCP tools when memory is needed.

## Integration capabilities

| Capability | OpenClaw plugin | Hermes MCP server |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native lifecycle auto-recall | Yes, before each agent turn | No; an agent invokes `memorybank_search` explicitly |
| Native lifecycle auto-capture | Yes, after substantive turns | No; an agent invokes `memorybank_remember` explicitly |
| Workspace memory-file sync | Yes | No |
| Reasoning-engine topic sync | Yes, on plugin startup | No |
| Memory operations | OpenClaw agent tools and CLI commands | Five user-invoked MCP tools over stdio |
| Shared memory | Yes, with matching project, location, reasoning engine, and scope | Yes, with the same matching configuration |

Hermes has **no native lifecycle auto-recall or auto-capture**. Its MCP server exposes only explicit, user-invoked tools.

## Prerequisites

1. A **Google Cloud project with billing enabled** and the **Agent Platform API** enabled. Enabling services requires `serviceusage.services.enable`, normally through `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin` (or a broader role).
2. IAM roles for the identity that runs an integration:
   - `roles/aiplatform.user` to create or update a Memory Bank instance.
   - `roles/aiplatform.memoryUser` to read, write, and generate memories.
   Use narrower Memory Bank viewer/editor roles where appropriate.
3. A reasoning engine / Memory Bank instance. The following compatibility SDK identifiers remain required by the current API surface:
   ```bash
   pip install google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.111.0
   ```
   ```python
   import vertexai
   client = vertexai.Client(project="YOUR_PROJECT", location="us-central1")
   agent_engine = client.agent_engines.create()
   print(agent_engine.api_resource.name)  # Save the reasoning engine ID
   ```
4. Application Default Credentials (ADC), for example:
   ```bash
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

See the official [setup guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/memory-bank/setup) and [API quickstart](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/memory-bank/api-quickstart).

## Install: OpenClaw plugin

### 1. Add plugin config to `openclaw.json`

Add configuration before installing the plugin so it can validate the required fields:

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "openclaw-vertexai-memorybank": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": {
          "projectId": "your-gcp-project-id",
          "location": "us-central1",
          "reasoningEngineId": "your-reasoning-engine-id"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Clone, build, and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/openclaw-vertexai-memorybank.git
cd openclaw-vertexai-memorybank
npm ci && npm run build
openclaw plugins install .
```

### 3. Add to the allowlist (recommended)

```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "allow": ["openclaw-vertexai-memorybank"],
    "entries": { "...": "..." }
  }
}
```

The legacy plugin ID above is intentionally retained as a compatibility identifier. Add it after installation because OpenClaw validates allowlisted plugins.

### 4. Restart OpenClaw

```bash
openclaw restart
```

### Bootstrapping from existing sessions

After installation, ask the agent to generate memories from selected prior sessions. The agent can parse that history and submit it for extraction; review scope and source content before backfilling.

## Install: Hermes MCP server

The package provides a dedicated MCP JSON-RPC-over-stdio server for Hermes. MCP responses are written only to stdout and diagnostics only to stderr.

### 1. Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/openclaw-vertexai-memorybank.git
cd openclaw-vertexai-memorybank
npm ci && npm run build
```

### 2. Configure Hermes with the checkout command

Add an entry to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, replacing the placeholder with the absolute path to this checkout. This `node` command is the primary installation path and works directly from a clone:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  agent_platform_memorybank:
    command: "node"
    args: ["/absolute/path/openclaw-vertexai-memorybank/bin/hermes-mcp.js"]
    env:
      MEMORYBANK_PROJECT_ID: "your-gcp-project-id"
      MEMORYBANK_LOCATION: "us-central1"
      MEMORYBANK_REASONING_ENGINE_ID: "your-reasoning-engine-id"
      # Hermes filters the stdio child environment. Pass service-account ADC explicitly.
      GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS: "/absolute/path/service-account.json"
      # Or use user ADC created by `gcloud auth application-default login`:
      # HOME: "${HOME}"
      # Match OpenClaw's scope exactly to enable sharing.
      MEMORYBANK_SCOPE: '{"user_id":"your-user-id"}'
    trust: untrusted
    tools:
      include:
        - memorybank_search
        - memorybank_remember
        - memorybank_forget
        - memorybank_correct
        - memorybank_stats
```

Optionally, after building, run `npm link` in the checkout (or install the package globally) to put `agent-platform-memorybank-hermes` on your `PATH`. Only then may the configuration use `command: "agent-platform-memorybank-hermes"` instead of the `node` command and absolute script path above.

Hermes supports `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation but deliberately filters stdio-child environments. Pass either an absolute `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` service-account path or `HOME` for user ADC. Unresolved `${...}` values in required Memory Bank settings are rejected. Review and trust the command path before adding it.

The `mcp_servers` key is user-chosen. This guide recommends `agent_platform_memorybank`, which produces `mcp__agent_platform_memorybank__memorybank_search`; choosing another key changes the `mcp__<key>__...` prefix. The allowlist limits discovery to these five tools; include mutating tools only where appropriate.

### 3. Test and reload

```bash
hermes mcp test agent_platform_memorybank
```

Then use `/reload-mcp` in Hermes after configuration changes.

## Hermes MCP tool surface

- `memorybank_search(query, top_k?)`
- `memorybank_remember(fact)`
- `memorybank_forget(memory_id)`
- `memorybank_correct(memory_id, new_fact)`
- `memorybank_stats()`

Malformed JSON-RPC requests and invalid arguments receive protocol errors or clean `isError` responses; stack traces are not sent over stdout.

## How it works

### OpenClaw lifecycle

```text
User message arrives
        |
        v
  [before_agent_start]    Retrieve top-K memories by similarity,
  (auto-recall)           optionally filter by distance, inject context
        |
        v
   Agent processes message
        |
        v
  [agent_end]             For substantive turns, submit the last pair
  (auto-capture)          to GenerateMemories for extraction/consolidation
        |
        v
  [agent_end]             Sync changed workspace memory files
  (file sync)             through GenerateMemories
```

### Hermes explicit MCP flow

Hermes does not register native lifecycle hooks. A Hermes user or agent explicitly calls an MCP tool: `memorybank_search` retrieves relevant facts, `memorybank_remember` writes a fact, and the remaining tools correct, forget, or inspect scoped memory.

### Shared Memory Bank operations

- **Recall/search** calls `RetrieveMemories` with semantic similarity search in the configured scope. Returned results are ordered from shortest to greatest Euclidean similarity distance. `maxDistance` is an OpenClaw plugin-side filter.
- **OpenClaw capture and file sync** call `GenerateMemories`. This extracts memories from source content and can consolidate generated facts with memories in the exact same scope.
- **Direct remember** calls `CreateMemory`. It writes the supplied fact immediately and can create duplicates until a later generation/consolidation run; it is not a `GenerateMemories` call.
- **OpenClaw noise filtering** skips capture when the user message is under 20 characters or the final message pair is under 100 characters.
- **OpenClaw topic sync** configures extraction topics, perspective, and examples on the reasoning engine.
- Authentication uses ADC.

## Configuration

### OpenClaw plugin options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `projectId` | string | **required** | Google Cloud project ID or number |
| `location` | string | **required** | Google Cloud region, for example `us-central1` |
| `reasoningEngineId` | string | **required** | reasoning engine ID; retained API/config identifier |
| `scope` | object | `{"agent_name":"openclaw"}` | immutable Memory Bank scope; exact matching regardless of key order |
| `autoRecall` | boolean | `true` | retrieve memories before each turn |
| `autoCapture` | boolean | `true` | generate memories after each turn |
| `autoSyncFiles` | boolean | `true` | generate memories from changed workspace markdown files |
| `autoSyncTopics` | boolean | `true` | configure extraction topics on startup |
| `memoryTopics` | array | built-in topics | custom memory topics |
| `perspective` | `"first"` \| `"third"` | `"third"` | generation perspective |
| `topK` | number | `10` | maximum similarity-search results |
| `maxDistance` | number | none | plugin-side maximum similarity distance; lower is stricter |
| `backgroundGenerate` | boolean | `true` | fire-and-forget capture/file generation; `true` does **not** wait for completion |
| `ttlSeconds` | number | none | **plugin configuration** mapped to generated-memory TTL settings; affects only generated memories, not direct `CreateMemory` remembers |
| `introspection` | `"off"` \| `"scores"` | `"scores"` | **plugin presentation setting** for recalled context; not an official API field name |

### Hermes MCP environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MEMORYBANK_PROJECT_ID` | yes | Google Cloud project ID or number |
| `MEMORYBANK_LOCATION` | yes | Agent Platform location |
| `MEMORYBANK_REASONING_ENGINE_ID` | yes | reasoning engine identifier (required compatibility configuration name) |
| `MEMORYBANK_SCOPE` | no | JSON scope; default `{"agent_name":"hermes"}` |
| `MEMORYBANK_TOP_K` | no | similarity-search result count, integer 1–100 |

### Shared memory scoping

Scope isolates memories and determines which memories are eligible for consolidation. It is a dictionary with these official constraints:

- At most **five** key/value pairs.
- Values cannot contain `*`.
- Scope matching is exact and independent of key order.
- Scope is immutable after a memory is created.

Use a `user_id`-only scope for cross-runtime sharing, or include an agent key for deliberate isolation:

```jsonc
{ "user_id": "shubham" }
// or
{ "user_id": "shubham", "agent_name": "openclaw" }
```

The Hermes default scope intentionally isolates this runtime. To share memory with OpenClaw, configure the identical `scope` object and `MEMORYBANK_SCOPE` value.

## Memory profiles

Agent Platform Memory Bank also supports structured **Memory Profiles**: one source-of-truth profile per schema and scope, maintained through the generation pipeline. This implementation currently handles natural-language memories only; it does not create, retrieve, or manage profile schemas. See the official [Memory Profiles guide](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/memory-bank/profiles).

## OpenClaw plugin defaults: topics, examples, and recall presentation

Unless `memoryTopics` is overridden, the OpenClaw plugin configures managed `USER_PREFERENCES`, `EXPLICIT_INSTRUCTIONS`, and `KEY_CONVERSATION_DETAILS` topics plus custom `technical_decisions`, `project_context`, and `action_items` topics. Built-in few-shot examples teach generation to retain decisions and preferences while ignoring short acknowledgments and transient debugging chatter.

`introspection` controls the OpenClaw plugin's recalled-context presentation: `scores` (the default) includes the returned similarity distance alongside each fact; `off` injects facts only. It does not change the Memory Bank API response.

`GenerateMemories` does not propagate caller metadata to generated memories in this implementation. Metadata is available to direct create/update calls; tagging generated results would require a later list-and-patch step, which this implementation does not perform.

## OpenClaw plugin surface

The OpenClaw plugin runs alongside OpenClaw's built-in `memory-core` and adds cloud-backed long-term memory.

### Agent tools

These four tools are registered for the OpenClaw agent:

| Tool | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `memorybank_search` | `RetrieveMemories` similarity search; returns facts, similarity distance, topics, timestamps, and IDs |
| `memorybank_forget` | deletes one memory by ID or resource name |
| `memorybank_correct` | updates a fact, with a delete-and-regenerate fallback that attempts to restore the old direct memory on failure |
| `memorybank_stats` | returns a scoped count and topic breakdown |

### CLI commands

The actual OpenClaw CLI commands are distinct from agent tools:

| Command | Options / behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `memorybank-status` | displays plugin configuration, connection state, and tracked-file state; refreshes the scoped count |
| `memorybank-search <query>` | `--top-k N`, `--show-ids`; similarity search with returned distances |
| `memorybank-list` | `--count-only`, `--show-ids`; paginated scoped listing or lightweight count |
| `memorybank-sync` | synchronizes changed workspace memory files |
| `memorybank-remember <fact>` | direct `CreateMemory` write; duplicates can persist until later generation consolidation |
| `memorybank-forget <memoryId>` | deletes a memory; IDs come from search/list `--show-ids` |

The count cache is in-memory for five minutes and is adjusted after direct create/delete operations; count-only/status can force a fresh paginated count. `GetMemory` fetches one named memory, `RetrieveMemories` is for all-in-scope or similarity retrieval, and `ListMemories` enumerates memories with pagination.

## Troubleshooting and security

- Use ADC (`gcloud auth application-default login`) locally, or an explicit service-account path in Hermes. Never commit credential files.
- Hermes runs the configured command as a local process. Review its absolute path and use `tools.include` to limit access, especially to `memorybank_forget` and `memorybank_correct`.
- Use identical project, location, reasoning engine, and scope in Hermes and OpenClaw to share memories. Scope mismatches intentionally return separate memory sets.
- Check stderr for `[memorybank]` diagnostics; stdout is MCP JSON-RPC only.
